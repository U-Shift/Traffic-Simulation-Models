## Work day vs. weekend

With the same method presented in [Accessibility](accessibility.qmd), let's compare the population that can be reach from city center on a **peak hour** and a **Sunday evening**, using **public transit** and max 1 transfer.

### Public transit - services available

First, we can have a look at the available routes on both time periods.
We use [`tidytransit::filter_feed_by_date()`](https://r-transit.github.io/tidytransit/reference/filter_feed_by_date.html) function, to filter our GTFS by **day** and by **hour**.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# Example with Carris
carris_different_trips_all = length(unique(gtfs_carris$trips$trip_id)) # 53028

# wednesday morning
carris_wednesday = gtfs_carris |> filter_feed_by_date("2025-10-01")
carris_different_trips_wednesday = length(unique(carris_wednesday$trips$trip_id)) # 11504
carris_wednesday_peakh = gtfs_carris |> filter_feed_by_date("2025-10-01",
                                                            min_departure_time = "08:00:00",
                                                            max_arrival_time = "09:00:00")
carris_different_trips_wednesday_h = length(unique(carris_wednesday_peakh$trips$trip_id)) # 1352

# sunday evening
carris_sunday = gtfs_carris |> filter_feed_by_date("2025-10-05")
carris_different_trips_sunday = length(unique(carris_sunday$trips$trip_id)) # 6268
carris_sunday_peakh = gtfs_carris |> filter_feed_by_date("2025-10-05",
                                                          min_departure_time = "22:00:00",
                                                          max_arrival_time = "23:00:00")
carris_different_trips_sunday_h = length(unique(carris_sunday_peakh$trips$trip_id)) # 264

# comparision
carris_different_trips_sunday/carris_different_trips_wednesday # 54%
carris_different_trips_sunday_h/carris_different_trips_wednesday_h # 19%
```

For instance, for Carris (bus operator), on a Sunday there are **54%** of the departures of a Wednesday, and on a Sunday evening (22h) there are **19%** of the departures that are on a Wednesday morning (8h).

#### Transfers needed to reach all stops

By considering the PTransit stops as destinations (and not population), we can also estimate how many bus stops are reacheble, in total and by number of transfers needed, for each our.

These estimates are based on GTFS data only, and do not rely on r5r.

```{r}
summary(gtfs_carris)
```

```         
tidygtfs object
files        agency, stops, routes, trips, stop_times, calendar, calendar_dates, shapes, transfers
agency       Carris
service      from 2025-09-01 to 2025-12-01
uses         stop_times (no frequencies)
# routes       175
# trips      53028
# stop_ids    2341
# stop_names  1139
# shapes       307
```

```{r}
# We will use the Cais Sodré bus stop name
from_station = "Cais Sodré"
stop_times_carris = filter_stop_times(gtfs_carris, "2025-10-01", "08:00:00", "09:00:00")
trip_duration_cais = travel_times(stop_times_carris, from_station, stop_dist_check = FALSE)

nrow(trip_duration_cais) # 989

summary(trip_duration_cais$travel_time/60) # in minutos
```

```         
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   0.00   19.85   29.87   29.72   40.02   62.30 
```

Not counting the waiting time at *Cais do Sodré* it is possible to reach 989 stops in the network (**42%**) during rush hour—within the 1 hour time frame defined.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
round(prop.table(table(trip_duration_cais$transfers))*100, 1) # transfers percentage
```

```         
   0    1    2    3 
22.6 55.5 19.7  2.1 
```

Only **22%** of stops are directly accessible (**without bus transfers**).
78% are accessible with a maximum of 1 transfer, and 2.1% of stops require at least 4 buses to reach (3 transfers).

### Compare population

Based on Census 2021 [@INEcensus], we can count how many people are reach.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
poplisboa = sum(POINTS$residents) #

100* sum(ttm_zer_PT_wednesday$residents[ttm_zer_PT_wednesday$travel_time_p50 <= 60]) / poplisboa # 98.9%

## New metro station or metro line

Let's create a new metro line or a new station in your city.

![New pink line (expansion in Lisbon)](images/clipboard-1897244126.png){fig-align="center"}

### Methodology

For that, an easy graphic interface software is the PTV Lines.

1.  Login into [PTV Lines](https://www.ptvgroup.com/en/products/ptv-lines) (upper right corner) with the credentials that were sent to you.
2.  Create a new scenario, and import an existing subway gtfs (`.zip`) - **max 50 lines**!
3.  Edit that scenario by creating stops and lines.
4.  Export the GTFS file.
5.  Duplicate your r5r folder (baseline scenario) and delete the `network.dat` file inside. Rename it as `..._ver1` and replace the `gtfs.zip` by the one you just exported.
6.  Build a new network with that folder path.

### Create a metro line with PTV Lines {#create-a-metro-line-with-ptv-lines}

First, create new station points (`S`) and name them.
As many as you need.

![](images/clipboard-4144832314.png){fig-align="center" width="231"}

![](images/clipboard-4243677038.png){fig-align="center"}

Then, create a new line (`L`), name it something like "Expansion", and create a new route (`R`).
Name it `0` (you can edit later) and draw that line roughly by selecting an existing start station and connecting to your new stations.

![](images/clipboard-1488195502.png){fig-align="center" width="369"}

Add trips to it (`T`), with a proper headway.

![](images/clipboard-2022476792.png){fig-align="center" width="421"}

After defining the weekday and weekend trips, go to the Outbound route and "*Create opposite direction*", so you can have both directions now.
Rename the line routes, something as "*Start station - End station*".

![](images/clipboard-563058203.png){fig-align="center" width="345"}

### Extend a metro line with PTV Lines

This tutorial assumes that the stations for which the line will be extended to already exist (if not, see how to create new stations at [Create a metro line with PTV Lines](#create-a-metro-line-with-ptv-lines)).

The extension is performed over a route.
To access one, click on a transit line, and then on one of its routes.

On the map, hover the Start/End buttons and click it to enable the extension mode.

![](images/extend_route_map_start_end_hover.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
::::::

Once the extension mode is activated, your cursor will turn into a pen icon and you just have to click on the station you want to expand your line to.

::: {.callout-caution appearance="minimal"}
## Routing modes

Be aware of the several modes available on the button that is now displayed (automatic routing mode, street routing mode, straight line mode or exclusive PT routing mode).
Make sure you use the one that best suits your use case.
:::

![](images/extend_route_map_draw_mode.png){fig-align="center"}

Once you click on the station, you should see the new station in the route window, on the left part of the screen.
You should adjust the run and dwell times accordingly.

![](images/extend_route_map_done.png){fig-align="center"}

### Visualizing time diagram

Go to Connections, and click on a connecting station to visualize the time diagram of connections with other routes.

![](images/clipboard-4040021677.png){fig-align="center"}

### Generate GTFS

After all your edits, go back to the dashboard, and click on "Export supply".
Export as GTFS (`.zip`)

![](images/clipboard-2244082372.png)

Your scenario will be saved in your dashboard.
You can edit or duplicate them later.

::: {.callout-caution appearance="minimal"}
### Your task

Run some routing and accessibility analysis, and compare with the baseline scenario.

Consider comparing the estimated cost of your new infrastructure and the mobility gains.
:::

See @accessibility [Chapter 6](https://ipeagit.github.io/intro_access_book/6_cenarios_transporte.en.html) for an example.

If you do multi-modal analysis, you **may need** to use [`GTFShift::unify()`](https://u-shift.github.io/GTFShift/reference/unify.html) to merge the new gtfs with other modes and create new transfers.

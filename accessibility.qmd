# Isochrones

In this chapter we will guide you through the installation of R, RStudio and the packages you will need for this course, for the macro network models.

**R** and **RStudio**[^1] are separate downloads.

[^1]: We will use RStudio, although if you already use other studio such as VScode, that's also fine.

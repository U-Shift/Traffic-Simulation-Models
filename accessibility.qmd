## Scenarios

### Work day vs. weekend

### With and without a metro station or metro line

Let's create a new metro line or a new station in your city.

#### Methodology

For that, an easy graphic interface software is the PTV Lines.

1.  Login into [PTV Lines](https://www.ptvgroup.com/en/products/ptv-lines) (upper right corner) with the credentials that were sent to you.
2.  Create a new scenario, and import an existing subway gtfs (`.zip`) - **max 60 lines**!
3.  Edit that scenario by creating stops and lines.
4.  Export the GTFS file.
5.  Duplicate your r5r folder (baseline scenario) and delete the `network.dat` file inside. Rename it as `..._sen1` and replace the `gtfs.zip` by the one you just exported.
6.  Build a new network with that folder path.

#### Create a metro line with PTV Lines

First, create new station points (`S`) and name them. As many as you need.

Then, create a new line (`L`), name it something like "Expansion", and create a new route (`R`). Name it `0` (you can edit later) and draw that line roughly by selecting an existing start station and connecting to your new stations.

Add trips to it (`T`), with a proper headway.

After defining the weekday and weekend trips, go to the Outbound route and "*Create opposite direction*", so you can have both directions now. Rename the line routes, something as "*Start station - End station*".

Go to Connections, and click on a connecting station to visualize the time diagram of connections with other routes.

After all your edits, go back to the dashboard, and click on "Export supply". Export as GTFS (`.zip`)

Your scenario will be saved in your dashboard. You can edit or duplicate them later.

## Your task

Run some routing and accessibility analysis, and compare with the baseline scenario.

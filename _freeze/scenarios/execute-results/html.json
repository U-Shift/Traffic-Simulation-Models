Login into [PTV Lines](https://www.ptvgroup.com/en/products/ptv-lines) (upper right corner) with the credentials that were sent to you.\n2.  Create a new scenario, and import an existing subway gtfs (`.zip`) - **max 60 lines**!\n3.  Edit that scenario by creating stops and lines.\n4.  Export the GTFS file.\n5.  Duplicate your r5r folder (baseline scenario) and delete the `network.dat` file inside. Rename it as `..._sen1` and replace the `gtfs.zip` by the one you just exported.\n6.  Build a new network with that folder path.\n\n### Create a metro line with PTV Lines\n\nFirst, create new station points (`S`) and name them. As many as you need.\n\n![](images/clipboard-4144832314.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"231\"}\n\n![](images/clipboard-4243677038.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThen, create a new line (`L`), name it something like \"Expansion\", and create a new route (`R`). Name it `0` (you can edit later) and draw that line roughly by selecting an existing start station and connecting to your new stations.\n\n![](images/clipboard-1488195502.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"369\"}\n\nAdd trips to it (`T`), with a proper headway.\n\n![](images/clipboard-2022476792.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"421\"}\n\nAfter defining the weekday and weekend trips, go to the Outbound route and \"*Create opposite direction*\", so you can have both directions now. Rename the line routes, something as \"*Start station - End station*\".\n\n![](images/clipboard-563058203.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"345\"}\n\nGo to Connections, and click on a connecting station to visualize the time diagram of connections with other routes.\n\n![](images/clipboard-4040021677.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nAfter all your edits, go back to the dashboard, and click on \"Export supply\". Export as GTFS (`.zip`)\n\n![](images/clipboard-2244082372.png)\n\nYour scenario will be saved in your dashboard. You can edit or duplicate them later.\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\"}\n### Your task\n\nRun some routing and accessibility analysis, and compare with the baseline scenario.\n:::\n\nIf you do multi-modal analysis, you **may need** to use [`GTFShift::unify()`](https://u-shift.github.io/GTFShift/reference/unify.html) to merge the new gtfs with other modes and create new transfers.\n",

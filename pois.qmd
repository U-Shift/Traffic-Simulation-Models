## Points of Interest

### OpenStreetMap

From [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) we can export several different **opportunities** to use on routing and accessibility exercises.

For instance, the **15-min city** idea follows the [Flowers of Proximity](https://www.flowersofproximity.com/), to categorize the opportinities in 7 different categories, based on @flowers2022.

[![The Flowers of Proximity](https://www.flowersofproximity.com/flower_of_proximity_large.svg){fig-align="center" width="400"}](https://www.flowersofproximity.com)

For the [Streets4All](https://streets4all.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) project, and [SiteSelection](https://u-shift.github.io/SiteSelection/) package [@siteselection2024], we divided in:

-   Amenities
-   Healthcare
-   Leisure
-   Shop
-   Sport
-   Tourism

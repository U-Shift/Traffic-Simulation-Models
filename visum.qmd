> Note: This tutorial is only for Windows. If you do not use Windows, you need to have a Virtual Machine.

In this tutorial we will guide you to install and start using Visum.

[PTV Visum](https://www.ptvgroup.com/en/products/ptv-visum) is a macro simulation software, non-free, available only for Windows OS.

## Installation

PTV Visum is available to download at: <https://cgi.ptvgroup.com/visionSetups/en/filter;product=PTV%20Visum>

Choose the most recent version. The file may be more than 1.3 GB.

If you don't have Python installed already in your PC, don't worry, you can opt to install it along the Visum setup.

The [available instructions](https://us-resources.ptvgroup.com/en-us/ptv-support/ptv-visum-installation) are very straight forward.

### Licence activation

You should have received a path to where the licence lives in our server.

To activate Visum, prior to use it, you need to download another tiny software: [CodeMeter Runtime](https://us-resources.ptvgroup.com/en-us/ptv-support/ptv-visum-installation)

After install it, open CodeMeter Control Center, and go to "Web Admin"

Relaunch CodeMeter, and see if you now have the PTV Visum licence available and running. It should look like this:

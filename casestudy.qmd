# Data

Please [download](https://github.com/U-Shift/Traffic-Simulation-Models/raw/main/data/Alfragide2024_HA.ver) the VISUM project file (`.ver`) with the base data that you will need.

## Road Network

We are using a road network exported from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

We already imported that network to this project as follows:

-   Select only Urban Road Network (to keep the principal roads)

This is what it looks like when importing from OSM.

### Check network integrity

Start by these ones (General, and links not connected to the network)

![](images/clipboard-2361827747.png)

*ignore warnings*

Set to active the ones you want to have a look.
They are now active/selected.
Delete if needed (`DEL` button)

## Zones

These are the zones to consider in the area.

They are from census 2021 sections, and aggregated in larger TAZ.

![](images/clipboard-1301163512.png)

This is how it looks like after importing the shapefile of zones to the project.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
We already added the **external zones** (rest of the world) and the associated **connectors** to the road network.

## OD Matrix

Create an OD matrix

![![](images/clipboard-1930862873.png)](images/clipboard-3868299757.png)

Give it a proper name.

And copy-paste data from excel

![](images/clipboard-26627273.png)

Now you have your OD matrix with data for your HA Group

# Procedures

After creating **all Zones' Connectors**

![](images/clipboard-2686935511.png)

Create PrT[^1] assignment

[^1]: Private Transport

![](images/clipboard-4248181563.png)

And then you need to explicit where the data comes from (your matrix).
Go to menu: Demand ‚ü∂ Demand Data

![](images/clipboard-768515232.png)

![](images/clipboard-428810323.png)

Select **your matrix**.

::: callout-tip
It is a good practice to add a *Delete assignment results* in the beginning of your procedure sequence.

Then run!

# Other things you can do

## Create a link

![](images/clipboard-3247333808.png)

I will first check the characteristics of the previous link that I'm connecting to, by double-click the link in the editor, and see the details.
The Quick View panel also shows some of its information.

![](images/clipboard-1068049222.png)

This is a Type no `50`.

Create a link by connecting both nodes.

![](images/clipboard-1812728369.png)

When creating a link, a window will popup to define some of the link parameters.
In this case I will also make it a type 50 link.

![](images/clipboard-3053698979.png)

![](images/clipboard-832922992.png)

Clicking 2 times in the new link, you can change some of the parameters.
It will highlight the ones that are not mirrored to the opposite direction - you should also transfer the new modifications.

![](images/clipboard-3757390393.png)

To make realistic links, activate background map before proceeding.

![](images/clipboard-3137847083.png)

Verify if the link is well connected with [Check network integrity], or estimating a [shortest path] between zones (with connectors).

## Shortest path

![](images/clipboard-2105325129.png){width="351"}

Click on 2 zones and run.

![](images/clipboard-2328021961.png){width="530"}

See the opposite direction

![](images/clipboard-2862225576.png)

Reset for a new one.

## Selection Mode

![](images/clipboard-1558298406.png)

## Labels

Change the zone label to name:

![![](images/clipboard-3732879755.png)](images/clipboard-3116914154.png)

The same if you want to remove the symbol representation of links

![](images/clipboard-3764395377.png)

You can save these visualization as a **Graphic parameter file**, so you can shift between one or more, depending on the assessment you are doing.

## Stop

`r5r` objects are still allocated to any amount of memory previously set after they are done with their calculations.
In order to remove an existing `r5r` object and reallocate the memory it had been using, we use the `stop_r5` function followed by a call to Javaâ€™s garbage collector, as follows:

```{r}
r5r::stop_r5(r5r_lisboa)
rJava::.jgc(R.gc = TRUE)
```

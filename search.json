    "text": "Macro vs. Micro\n\nMacro simulators\nSome softwares can be more appropriated if using a large scale, such as regional or city-wide area. For instance, the traffic impacts on the development of a new centrality (hospital, airport), or in the introduction of a new bridge or freeway can be simulated with macro simulator software.\nPTV Visum, Aimsun, and MatSim are examples of software to deal with a large scale simulation.\nFor macro simulations it is essential do consider zoning, flows, etc.\nUsually this type of simulators can smoothly integrate Public Transport information, such as GTFS files.\n\n\nMicro simulators\nWant to simulate changes at a street or neighbourhood level? Then micro simulator software should be used.\nPTV Visim, SUMO, and A/B Street are examples of software to deal with a micro scale simulation.",

Keep in mind that the University of Lisbon provides Windows stutent’s licences.\nFor Linux (Ubuntu or Debian) users, Gnome Boxes are an interesting option to run Windows.\nFor Windows users, you should have no problem using any software.\n\nPTV Visum and Visim are only available for Windows.",

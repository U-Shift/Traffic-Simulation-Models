    "text": "New metro station or metro line\nLet’s create a new metro line or a new station in your city.\n\n\n\nNew pink line (expansion in Lisbon)\n\n\n\nMethodology\nFor that, an easy graphic interface software is the PTV Lines.\n\nLogin into PTV Lines (upper right corner) with the credentials that were sent to you.\nCreate a new scenario, and import an existing subway gtfs (.zip) - max 50 lines!\nEdit that scenario by creating stops and lines.\nExport the GTFS file.\nDuplicate your r5r folder (baseline scenario) and delete the network.dat file inside. Rename it as ..._ver1 and replace the gtfs.zip by the one you just exported.\nBuild a new network with that folder path.\n\n\n\nCreate a metro line with PTV Lines\nFirst, create new station points (S) and name them. As many as you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, create a new line (L), name it something like “Expansion”, and create a new route (R). Name it 0 (you can edit later) and draw that line roughly by selecting an existing start station and connecting to your new stations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd trips to it (T), with a proper headway.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter defining the weekday and weekend trips, go to the Outbound route and “Create opposite direction”, so you can have both directions now. Rename the line routes, something as “Start station - End station”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtend a metro line with PTV Lines\nThis tutorial assumes that the stations for which the line will be extended to already exist (if not, see how to create new stations at Create a metro line with PTV Lines).\nThe extension is performed over a route. To access one, click on a transit line, and then on one of its routes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the map, hover the Start/End buttons and click it to enable the extension mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the extension mode is activated, your cursor will turn into a pen icon and you just have to click on the station you want to expand your line to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouting modes\n\n\n\nBe aware of the several modes available on the button that is now displayed (automatic routing mode, street routing mode, straight line mode or exclusive PT routing mode). Make sure you use the one that best suits your use case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you click on the station, you should see the new station in the route window, on the left part of the screen. You should adjust the run and dwell times accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing time diagram\nGo to Connections, and click on a connecting station to visualize the time diagram of connections with other routes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate GTFS\nAfter all your edits, go back to the dashboard, and click on “Export supply”. Export as GTFS (.zip)\n\nYour scenario will be saved in your dashboard. You can edit or duplicate them later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour task\n\n\n\nRun some routing and accessibility analysis, and compare with the baseline scenario.\n\n\nSee Pereira and Herszenhut (2023) Chapter 6 for an example.\nIf you do multi-modal analysis, you may need to use GTFShift::unify() to merge the new gtfs with other modes and create new transfers.",

    "text": "Getting started\nOpen SUMO-gui (Graphic User Interface). You should have a window like this:\n\nSeveral tutorials are available. Try these ones:\n\nHello World - Creating a simple network and demand scenario with netedit and visualizing it using sumo-gui\nOSMWebWizard - Setting up a scenario with just a few clicks using osmWebWizard.py; getting a network from OpenStreetMap\nQuick Start - A more complex tutorial with netedit; first steps in SUMO\nDriving in Circles - Work with netedit; define a flow; let vehicles drive in circles using rerouters\nSUMOlympics - Create special lanes and simple traffic lights in netedit, more about flows and vehicle types, working with vehicle\nAutobahn - Build a highway, create a mixed highway flow, visualize vehicle speed, save view settings\nImporting GTFS - Importing public transport schedules from public sources using the General Transit Feed Specification\n\n\n\nImport from OpenStreetMap\nThis requires having Python installed.\n\nWindows: Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; OSM Web Wizard\nMacOS: 🐼\nLinux (terminal):\n\ncd ~/sumo/tools\npython3 osmWebWizard.py\nAnd a window will open in your browser.\n\nYou may zoom and pan to the area of your interest1. Click on “Select Area” and draw a rectangle with your mouse for which you wish to generate the simulation scenario.\n\nNetwork Generation\nThe infrastructure import from OSM into the SUMO simulation are affected by different Wizard options\n\nby default the “Add Polygon” checkbox is checked and a road traffic simulation is generated but all types of roads and rails will be imported as well (cycle paths, footpaths, railways etc)\nif the checkbox “left-hand Traffic” is enabled, the network will be built with left hand traffic rules. For most geographic regions where this is required, this feature will be enabled automatically but if it does not work, this option can be used as a remedy.\nif the checkbox “Car-only Network” is enabled, then only roads that permit passenger car traffic will be included. This can be used to reduce the network size and also helps to reduce intersection complexity\nif the checkbox “Import Public Transport” is enabled, then busStops and trainStops will be exported. Also busses, trams and trains will be generated that follow the public transport routes defined in OSM (but they will follow synthetic schedules).\nif the Demand-checkbox “Bicycles” is active, then extra bicycle lanes will be added to roads where OSM contains this information\nif the Demand-checkbox “Pedestrians” is active, then sidewalks and pedestrian crossings will be generated\n\n\n\nDemand Generation\nThe demand is defined by the demand generation panel. You activate this panel by clicking on the car pictogram.\n\nSUMO supports various modes of transport. At the demand generation panel, you can activate/deactivate the individual modes of transport by clicking the corresponding checkboxes. For each mode of transport, the OSM Web Wizard generates random demand based on a certain probability distribution, which is influenced by two parameters:\n\nEvery time a new vehicle is generated, the OSM Web Wizard randomly chooses a departure and arrival edge for the vehicle. The Through Traffic Factor defines how many times it is more likely for an edge at the boundary of the simulation area being chosen, compared to an edge entirely located inside the simulation area. A big value for the Through Traffic Factor implies that many vehicles depart and arrive at the boundary of the simulation area, which corresponds to a scenario with a lot of through traffic.\nThe Count parameter defines how many vehicles are generated per hour and lane-kilometer. Assuming\n\nthe network contains 3 edges with a combined length of 5 km\nthat each has 2 lanes which allows the current traffic mode\nand the count value is set to 90,\nthen 5 * 2 * 90 = 900 vehicles per hour will be generated.\n\n\nThis translates to a randomTrips parameter of p=4 which means a new vehicle is inserted every 4 seconds somewhere in the network.\nThe next step is generating and running the scenario.\n\n\nRoad-Type Selection\nIn the Road-Type tab of the OSM Web Wizard one can define which road types to be downloaded and rendered.\n\nFor example, one can only choose motorways, primary, secondary and tertiary to simulate major traffic. This impacts the file size of the OSM map data.\nBy default, all road types are checked which implies downloading and rendering all roads.\nUnchecking the “Add Polygon” checkbox in the Demand Generation section disables downloading and rendering non-road objects like buildings, waterways, etc. resulting in a smaller file size.\n\n\nGenerating and Running the scenario\nThe complete scenario will be generated automatically once Generate Scenario in the control panel has been clicked. The scenario generation takes a couple of seconds or minutes (depending, among other factors, on the size of the scenario).\nOnce the scenario generation process has finished, the sumo-gui starts and the simulation can be started by pressing the Play button.\n You will see agents making their trips. Adjust the Delay to make it faster or slower.\n\nA new directory under your user folder ~/SUMO/yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss will be created to host the data and results. You may now edit those files and re-run the simulation (open run file).\n\n\n\nUse the case study data\n\nSoon 🥽",
